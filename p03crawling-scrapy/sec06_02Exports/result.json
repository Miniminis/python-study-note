  "content": "Leviton’s Decora Smart Wi-Fi 4-Button Controller is like a miniature nerve center for your home’s lighting, provided your home’s lighting is controlled by other Decora Smart Wi-Fi devices (e.g., switches, dimmers, outlets, plugs, and ceiling-fan controllers). It can control multiples of these other devices, it can trigger multi-room lighting scenes, or it can simply function as a remote toggle switch for them.It’s an unusual device, however, in that it can’t control a local load. As such, you wouldn’t use it to replace an  switch or dimmer. That makes it most useful for new construction, although a professional electrician or a knowledgeable DIYer can perform a retrofit installation. In that case, you’ll need to pull Romex cable from somewhere, cut a hole in the wall where you want the controller to be, install what’s known as an “old work box,” and then make your wiring connections (you’ll connect only the line, neutral, and ground wires). Leviton tells me they’re working on a second version of this controller that  be able to control a local load.I just happened to have a similar multi-button controller that was installed when I built my house back in 2007. But it never worked the way it was supposed to and has been something of a vestigial eyesore ever since. But like Leviton’s product, it was wired with just a line, a neutral, and a ground wire, and it didn’t control any load itself. Leviton’s 4-Button Controller was not only exactly what I needed, it also solved another problem that’s bedeviled me since we moved in.The light on my back porch is controlled by a single switch in my sun room, which is adjacent to my master bedroom on the far side of my home. When I’m in the main part of the house at night and need to turn that light on, it’s a long walk to get to that switch. My earlier solution was to install a Z-Wave smart switch there and connect it to my Vivint smart home system. That enabled me to control the switch with my smartphone at first, and then with a voice command when I deployed Amazon Echoes around the house. But there have been times when I didn’t want to bark at Alexa, and it’s not always convenient to walk over to an Echo so I can use whisper mode.When I installed Leviton’s 4-Button Controller, I replaced that Z-Wave switch with a Decora Smart Wi-Fi switch and assigned one of the controller’s buttons to toggle that light on and off. I can still also use voice commands, but I only need to walk a few steps to press a button. The controller’s buttons can also do much more than toggle lights, and in some scenarios, each button can control more than one remote device.You have three choices for programming each of the controller’s four buttons using the My Leviton app: First, you can set each button to toggle a single Decora Smart Wi-Fi device—a light switch, dimmer, ceiling-fan controller, outlet, or smart plug—on and off when you press the button. Second, you can program each button to “control” multiple devices (turning on a ceiling fan at a predetermined speed—low, medium, high, or max—turning a dimmer on at a predefined brightness—on a scale of 10 to 100 percent—or turning a switch on). Alternatively, you can program the button to turn any of those devices . The third option is to have a button run an “activity” when you push it. Activities are sequences of events—turning one or more dimmers on at a predefined brightness, for instance.I found the toggle function to be the most useful option. Think of it as a remote control for any other Decora Smart device you have installed in your home. You can turn a light on before you head to another room, so that the room is already lit when you get there. And if you forgot to turn a light off when you left a room, you can do it remotely from the controller.You’ll need to know what state the device is in before you press the button, though, because there’s no feedback loop. A green LED below the button will light up when you press it, but it doesn’t stay lit to tell the controlled devices are on. The LED on the fourth button can be programmed to stay lit as a location aid in the dark, or you can leave it turned off if you don’t want the light pollution.The toggle feature is also useful for controlling porch, patio, and garage lights from the center of your home or from a bedroom, so you don’t need to walk out to a perimeter wall where the primary switch is probably located. This can be a matter of safety as well as convenience, because it could allow you to avoid walking past a window if you’re worried an intruder might be lurking outside. What the toggle function  do is set a dimmer’s brightness level. When it turns on a light controlled by a dimmer, it simply turns the light on at the level the local dimmer it’s wired to is set at.The control option that works with multiple devices would be much more useful if it could toggle devices between states in the same way, but it can’t. The button can turn a device on or off, and it can set a dimmer to a defined brightness level or a ceiling fan to a defined speed, but the device will remain in that state until it’s changed via some other action—pressing the button on the local switch, for example, or controlling it from within the app. So, if you program the button to turn on six devices at once, you’ll need to turn all six devices off one by one (unless you program another of the controller’s four button to do that). This option could be useful for a “panic” situation: If you hear a bump in the night, you could press one button that would turn all the lights on inside and outside your home.The final option, activities, can control multiple rooms, multiple devices, or a combination of the two. As such, it’s most useful for creating lighting scenes. I created a “good night” activity, for instance, that turned off all the lights and the ceiling fan in my home that are controlled by Decora Smart controls. You might want to create a “movie night” activity that dims all the lights in your home theater, turns off the overhead lights in your kitchen off, but leaves the lights on over your kitchen counter, so you can come in later to make popcorn. As with the control option, however, you’ll need to create a second activity to switch the state of all the devices back to off. You don’t necessarily need to assign either of these programming changes to a button, however, you could just as easily pull out your smartphone or tablet and execute them that way.It’s worth noting that you can create similar routines with essentially any smart switch or smart bulb and a smart speaker. Amazon, for example, calls these “routines” in its Alexa app. The biggest advantage to using smart speaker routine over using Leviton’s app is that smart speakers are brand agnostic—you can mix Leviton’s Decora Smart controls with, say, Philips Hue smart bulbs and a Lutron smart shade controller. The argument in favor of using Leviton’s software is that its app—being purpose-built for its own devices—is more intuitive to use and a whole lot faster. Leviton’s Decora Smart line is also compatible with IFTTT if you want to program the buttons to control non-Leviton devices.There are two features I wish Leviton’s 4-Button Controller had—in addition to the ability to control a local load, of course: First is the ability to control the brightness of a dimmer that’s assigned to one of its buttons. If this worked, you’d only be able to control the brightness of a dimmer using the toggle function (the first of the three control paradigms described above), but it would be handy. The buttons are rocker switches, so I thought this feature was already there and I just couldn’t figure out how to do it. It’s not.The second desired feature is having some way to label the physical buttons, so you can see how they’re programmed. Leviton has a four-button zone controller in its  (Z-Wave) product line that has removable buttons. When I evaluated it a few years ago, it came with a bag full of buttons with preprinted labels: Kitchen, Porch, Utility, and so on. You could pop its blank buttons off and replace them with the appropriately labeled ones, so you didn’t have to remember what each button did.  My workaround was to print my own adhesive labels—“B” for bedroom, “E” for entry—and stick them on the cover plate to the right of the relevant button. It’s not the prettiest solution, and I’ll need to replace the labels each time I reprogram the buttons, but it’s better than trying to remember what each button does. Speaking of cover plates, Leviton provides one with no visible screws (it snaps onto a subplate that you screw into the controller). Oh, and in case you’re wondering: Leviton says you can deploy up to eight of its four-button controllers in a single home.The fact that Leviton’s Smart Wi-Fi 4-Button Controller isn’t designed to control a local load makes it a highly specialized device. If you’re not replacing something similar, as I did, installing it in existing construction will be a lot of work. If you’re not an experienced DIYer, you might want to bring in an electrician to do the job.Programming it to control other Decora Smart Wi-Fi devices with the My Leviton app, on the other hand, is a piece of cake. Leviton’s app (I used both the Android and iOS versions) is snappy and responsive, and so are all of Leviton’s Decora Smart Wi-Fi dimmers, switches, and fan controllers. I haven’t tried the company’s smart plugs or smart outlets, but I have no reason to believe they’d be any less excellent.The bottom line is that the Leviton Decora Smart Wi-Fi 4-Button Controller will bring a welcome level of sophistication and convenience to your smart home like nothing else can.This story, \"Leviton Decora Smart Wi-Fi 4-Button Controller review: This device fits its niche almost perfectly\" was originally published by \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n."

  "title": "How to fine-tune Gmail for maximum productivity",
  "image": null,
  "content": "Email is a complicated beast. There are so many layers to mull over when it comes to making an inbox manageable, from the surface-level organizational factors (hello, !) to the more advanced under-the-hood features (, anyone?).But beyond all of that, even, is the issue of your actual inbox interface. It may seem trivial, but having an interface that emphasizes the functions you use most while minimizing unnecessary clutter can go a long way in making email easier to manage — both in terms of efficiency and for the simple matter of sanity. (I know  feel far less mentally stable after I've been staring at an awful interface for an hour!)Well, good news, my fellow Google-app dwellers: Gmail has one of the most customizable inbox interfaces around, and there's plenty you can do to make it both visually appealing  primed for productivity. By default, though, the Gmail website is kind of a cluttered mess — and it's up to  to fine-tune it.So let's do a little tuning, shall we? Here are eight smart steps you can take to optimize your Gmail inbox interface and turn it into a more effective home for all of your email-oriented needs.First up is that virtual clutter we were just discussing — and goodness gracious, does Gmail have heaps of it.Take, for instance, the service's importance markers. Those are the flag-shaped icons to the left of every email in your inbox, sandwiched between the star and the sender's name. On some emails, they appear as hollow outlines, while on others, they're filled in with a golden-yellow hue.Officially, those markers are meant to indicate whether messages are likely to be important to you, based on a  such as which emails you open and reply to. To me, though, they're just visual noise that in no way affects how I handle messages. They're also redundant with the sorting performed by the Primary tab in my Gmail inbox, which already serves to separate out important messages from inconsequential junk. So the only thing those indicators really accomplish is making my inbox more overwhelming and less easy to process.If you find them equally useless, send 'em a-packin' by clicking the gear icon in Gmail's upper-right corner, selecting \"Settings,\" and then selecting the \"Inbox\" tab at the top of the screen. See the section labeled \"Importance markers\"? Change its setting from \"Show markers\" to \"No markers,\" then click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the screen.Next, do you actually use Google's online messaging service — whichever messaging service you happen to have present alongside your Gmail inbox? ()Long story short, G Suite users now see the Slack-like Google Chat service (known as Hangouts Chat up until very recently) in the left-hand sidebar of the Gmail desktop interface, while non-G-Suite Gmail users see the original, consumer-focused Hangouts service (which has been in the  for what feels like an eternity now) in that same spot.And unless you're regularly using whichever service shows up in that area for you, its presence is likely providing little more than a disposable distraction. So zap it away and celebrate more clutter cleared: Just head back into Gmail's settings, select the \"Chat\" tab at the top, turn the toggle to \"Chat off,\" and then click the Save Changes button.Now, ask yourself this: Do you like the way Gmail shows email attachments as their own lines within your inbox, beneath the main content of their associated message? If you  find that to be a beneficial addition, you can turn those tiles off, save space, and give your inbox a more uniform appearance by clicking the gear-shaped icon in Gmail's upper-right corner, selecting \"Display density,\" and changing the setting from \"Default\" to \"Comfortable\" (a nice middle-of-the-road option) or \"Compact\" (a super-condensed, almost claustrophobic vibe that I wouldn't recommend for most people).Last but not least for this first step, let's talk about tabs. Assuming you're using Gmail's default tabbed inbox setup, think carefully about the five tabs at the top of your inbox and how much you rely on them. Are there any tabs that are of little to no meaningful value to you? Personally, for instance, I don't get many emails (that I care about) from social networks. So I've turned off the Social tab, which gives me one less place to feel obligated to check and makes my inbox even more minimal.If you have any tabs you don't rely on regularly, click that gear-shaped icon once more — and this time, select \"Configure inbox.\" There, you can uncheck any tabs you no longer want and have them vanish from your inbox entirely. Any messages that would have been filed into those tabs will simply be shifted to the next most appropriate tab that  still present.Speaking of the Gmail inbox style, by the way, don't forget that Gmail actually now offers five distinct inbox arrangements. If the default tabbed setup doesn't seem right to you, consider one of the alternate options — like an inbox arrangement that organizes your incoming messages into a single list, with unread emails first. I've got  devoted entirely to that subject, if you want to explore the possibilities in detail.My wife has a habit of leaving dresser drawers and cabinet doors open, and lemme tell ya: It drives me absolutely nuts. (Hi, honey!) Having virtual drawers hanging open all over the place creates the same sort of effect, minus the potential for head bonks: It adds clutter into the environment and makes it hard for your eyes to focus on the elements that actually matter.So take the simplest step possible in improving your Gmail interface and start shutting the damn drawers, would ya? (Sorry. Pent-up frustration from a vaguely related area.) There are two drawers worth closing whenever you aren't using 'em in Gmail:First is the Google service bar at the right side of the screen — that strip that holds icons for Calendar, Keep, and Tasks. Whenever you aren't using it, click the little right-facing arrow in its bottom corner and collapse it to clear out its clutter and reclaim that space.And second is the main Gmail menu on the left side of the screen, which can be similarly closed in order to repurpose the same space for your main message area. Click the three-line icon at its top to collapse it, then just hover your mouse over its collapsed form whenever you need the full menu to appear.Gmail's labels are , but sometimes your organizational system  needs a little optimization. (I can't even begin to tell you how much pleasure that brought me to say.)After all, it doesn't take much for Gmail's label lists to get unruly. And the more cluttered those lists become, the more difficult it is for you to find the labels you actually need and use often.Labels show up in two different places in Gmail — in the main menu to the left of your inbox and then also within individual messages, anytime you use the Label command. With very little effort, both of those spots can be cleaned up and condensed from the same streamlined tool.So make your way back into Gmail's settings, and this time click the \"Labels\" header at the top of the screen. There, you'll see a list of every label you've ever created, along with all the default system labels and categories. Next to each one, you'll see two columns: \"Show in label list,\" which controls whether a label is shown or hidden in the upper part of the main Gmail menu, and \"Show in message list,\" which controls a label's visibility in the list that pops up when you use that in-message Label command.Think through each label and category and consider how frequently you access it from either location. If a label isn't something you click on routinely, hide it. You'll still be able to get to it — by clicking the word \"More\" in the main Gmail menu or by using the search field within the in-message list — but it won't take up space on your screen and push the labels you  use regularly out of sight.If you use Gmail's stars system to mark messages in any way — such as giving extra emphasis to emails that are particularly pressing or those that warrant a reply — listen up: You don't have to stick with just a single star style.Gmail has the ability to give you  star options — different colors and styles — that you can reserve for different purposes. In my inbox, for example, I use one type of star for messages I need to reply to, another style of star for high-priority messages that need to be dealt with that same day, and yet another star style for messages that require some manner of processing (such as adding an event onto my calendar or marking an invoice as paid).You can add extra stars into your own mix by looking in the \"General\" tab of Gmail's settings and finding the \"Stars\" section midway down the page. Drag any designs you want to use from the \"Not in use\" row up to the \"In use\" row and then place them in whatever order you want. (Most likely you'll want the ones you use more frequently near the beginning.)Be sure to hit the Save Changes button at the bottom of the screen when you're done — and then, anytime you star a message, you can keep clicking the star icon to cycle through all your available choices. They'll appear in the same order you just established in the Gmail settings. (Annoyingly, this feature doesn't carry over to the Gmail mobile apps, but you'll have it on your desktop, at least.)I don't know about you, but I find Gmail's nudges — the service's habit of bringing messages to the top of the inbox with a distractingly bright reminder whenever the Google genie decides you're overdue to take action — incredibly annoying and also quite counterproductive. I have my own systems for managing email, and Gmail's attempts at trying to figure out what I do and don't need to respond to tend to be more hindrance than help, as they force me to waste time clearing away clutter I've already dealt with once.Unless you find those nudges to be useful, turn them off by looking in that same \"General\" tab of Gmail's settings and finding the option for \"Nudges.\" You'll see two different options there to uncheck.When you're scrolling through messages in Gmail, the last thing you want to do is keep clicking to continue on to the next page — and yet, by default, Gmail makes you do exactly that after every 50 messages.You can't break Gmail's pagination habit entirely, but what you  do is double the amount of messages it displays per screen. That way, you'll be able to see a hundred messages on a single page before having to click to load more. Hey, it's progress.The option you want to adjust is at the top of the \"General\" tab we were just looking at in Gmail's settings. Click the box next to \"Maximum page size\" and change it from \"50\" to \"100,\" then get ready to give your finger a break.Gmail's default appearance these days is quite white, but you don't have to stick with that mildly blinding motif. Click the gear-shaped icon in the website's upper-right corner and select \"Themes,\" then browse through the available options.Two simple choices worth considering are \"Dark,\" which effectively puts the entire Gmail website into a native dark mode, and \"Soft Gray,\" which is basically just an enhanced version of the default all-white theme — equally minimal but with more contrast to set the active message area apart from the surrounding menus.If you decide to go with a more graphical option, meanwhile — whether one of the many available photos and illustrations or your own uploaded image — take note of three subtle options for making the most of your custom color scheme:With the combination of those three settings, you can create some appealing visual effects that make your inbox minimally straining on your eyes and maximally pleasant to view.Finally, what might be the most impactful change you'll make to your Gmail inbox — the crowning touch upon this interface improving process: Try out an extension called . It's available for both  and . And it is, without exaggeration, the best part of my email experience.Simplify Gmail is the creation of a former Googler who served as Gmail's longtime design lead and was the co-creator of the company's short-lived Inbox experiment. It picks up where Inbox left off and rearranges the core Gmail interface to give it a cleaner, simpler, more minimal appearance that makes it infinitely easier to use.The extension doesn't involve any trackers, ads, or cookies, nor does it collect or use any manner of personal data. It's , if you want to look at the code to confirm that for yourself.With it and the other interface optimizations we just finished going over, your Gmail inbox will be a whole new beast — one that'll let you be more focused and consequently more productive than ever. And guess what? The more productive you are with email, the less time you'll have to spend staring at your inbox.And if there's one surefire way to make email more enjoyable, it's to spend less time doing it.This story, \"How to fine-tune Gmail for maximum productivity\" was originally published by \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n."

  "title": "What is Cython? Python at the speed of C",
  "image": null,
  "content": "Python has a reputation for being one of the most convenient, richly outfitted, and downright useful programming languages. Execution speed? Not so much.Enter Cython. The Cython language is a superset of Python that compiles to C, yielding  performance boosts that can range from a few percent to several orders of magnitude, depending on the task at hand. For work that is bound by Python’s native object types, the speedups won’t be large. But for numerical operations, or any operations not involving Python’s own internals, the gains can be massive. With Cython, you can skirt many of Python’s native limitations or transcend them entirely—without having to give up Python’s ease and convenience. In this article, we’ll walk through the basic concepts behind Cython and create a simple Python application that uses Cython to accelerate one of its functions.Python code can make calls directly into C modules. Those C modules can be either generic C libraries or libraries built specifically to work with Python. Cython generates the second kind of module: C libraries that talk to Python’s internals, and that can be bundled with existing Python code.Cython code looks a lot like Python code, by design. If you feed the Cython compiler a Python program (Python 2.x and Python 3.x are both supported), Cython will accept it as-is, but none of Cython’s native accelerations will come into play. But if you decorate the Python code with type annotations in Cython’s special syntax, Cython will be able to substitute fast C equivalents for slow Python objects.Note that Cython’s approach is . That means a developer can begin with an  Python application, and speed it up by making spot changes to the code, rather than rewriting the whole application from the ground up.This approach dovetails with the nature of software performance issues generally. In most programs, the vast majority of CPU-intensive code is concentrated in a few hot spots—a version of the Pareto principle, also known as the “80/20” rule. Thus most of the code in a Python application doesn’t need to be performance-optimized, just a few critical pieces. You can incrementally translate those hot spots into Cython, and so get the performance gains you need where it matters most. The rest of the program can remain in Python for the convenience of the developers.Consider the following code, taken from Cython’s documentation:This is a toy example, a not-very-efficient implementation of an . As pure Python code, it’s slow, because Python must convert back and forth between machine-native numerical types and its own internal object types.Now consider the Cython version of the same code, with Cython’s additions underscored:If we , both for the function parameters and the variables used in the body of the function (, , etc.), Cython will translate all of this into C. We can also use the  keyword to define functions that are implemented primarily in C for additional speed, although those functions can only be called by other Cython functions and not by Python scripts. (In the above example, only  can be called by another Python script.)Note how little our actual  has changed. All we’ve done is add type declarations to existing code to get a significant performance boost.Aside from being able to speed up the code you’ve already written, Cython grants several other advantages:Python packages like NumPy wrap C libraries in Python interfaces to make them easy to work with. However, going back and forth between Python and C through those wrappers can slow things down. Cython lets you talk to the underlying libraries directly, without Python in the way. (C++ libraries are also supported.)If you use Python objects, they’re memory-managed and garbage-collected the same as in regular Python. But if you want to create and manage your own C-level structures, and use / to work with them, you can do so. Just remember to clean up after yourself.Cython automatically performs runtime checks for common problems that pop up in C, such as out-of-bounds access on an array, by way of decorators and compiler directives (e.g., ). Consequently, C code generated by Cython is much safer by default than hand-rolled C code, though potentially at the cost of raw performance.If you’re confident you won’t need those checks at runtime, you can disable them for additional speed gains, either across an entire module or only on select functions.Cython also allows you to natively access Python structures that use the  for direct access to data stored in memory (without intermediate copying). Cython’s  let you work with those structures at high speed, and with the level of safety appropriate to the task. For instance, the raw data underlying a Python string can be read in this fashion (fast) without having to go through the Python runtime (slow).Python’s Global Interpreter Lock, or GIL, synchronizes threads within the interpreter, protecting access to Python objects and managing contention for resources. But the GIL has been widely criticized as a stumbling block to a better-performing Python, especially on multicore systems.If you have a section of code that makes no references to Python objects and performs a long-running operation, you can mark it with the  directive to allow it to run without the GIL. This frees up the Python interpreter to do other things, and allows Cython code to make use of multiple cores (with additional work).Python has a  that is used mainly by linters and code checkers, rather than the CPython interpreter. Cython has its own custom syntax for code decorations, but with recent revisions of Cython you can use Python type-hinting syntax to provide basic type hints to Cython as well. Python modules are trivially easy to decompile and inspect, but compiled binaries are not. When distributing a Python application to end users, if you want to protect some of its modules from casual snooping, you can do so by compiling them with Cython. Note, though, this is a  of Cython’s capabilities, not one of its intended functions.Keep in mind that Cython isn’t a magic wand. It doesn’t automatically turn every instance of poky Python code into sizzling-fast C code. To make the most of Cython, you must use it wisely—and understand its limitations:When Cython encounteres Python code it can’t translate completely into C, it transforms that code into a series of C calls to Python’s internals. This amounts to taking Python’s interpreter out of the execution loop, which gives code a modest 15 to 20 percent speedup by default. Note that this is a best-case scenario; in some situations, you might see no performance improvement, or even a performance degradation.Python provides a slew of data structures—strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and so on. They’re hugely convenient for developers, and they come with their own automatic memory management. But they’re slower than pure C.Cython lets you continue to use all of the Python data structures, although without much speedup. This is, again, because Cython simply calls the C APIs in the Python runtime that create and manipulate those objects. Thus Python data structures behave much like Cython-optimized Python code generally: You sometimes get a boost, but only a little. For best results, use C variables and structures. The good news is Cython makes it easy to work with them.If you have a function in C labeled with the  keyword, with all of its variables and inline function calls to other things that are pure C, it will run as fast as C can go. But if that function references any Python-native code, like a Python data structure or a call to an internal Python API, that call will be a performance bottleneck.Fortunately, Cython provides a way to spot these bottlenecks: a  that shows at a glance which parts of your Cython app are pure C and which parts interact with Python. The better optimized the app, the less interaction there will be with Python.Cython improves the use of C-based third-party number-crunching libraries like NumPy. Because Cython code compiles to C, it can interact with those libraries directly, and take Python’s bottlenecks out of the loop.But NumPy, in particular, works well with Cython. Cython has native support for specific constructions in NumPy and provides fast access to NumPy arrays. And the same familiar NumPy syntax you’d use in a conventional Python script can be used in Cython as-is.However, if you want to create the closest possible bindings between Cython and NumPy, you need to further decorate the code with Cython’s custom syntax. The  statement, for instance, allows Cython code to see C-level constructs in libraries at compile time for the fastest possible bindings.Since NumPy is so widely used, Cython  “out of the box.” If you have NumPy installed, you can just state  in your code, then  to use the exposed functions. You get the best performance from any piece of code by profiling it and seeing firsthand where the bottlenecks are. Cython , so you can use Python’s own profiling tools, like , to see how your Cython code performs. It helps to remember in all cases that Cython isn’t magic—that sensible real-world performance practices still apply. The less you shuttle back and forth between Python and Cython, the faster your app will run.For instance, if you have a collection of objects you want to process in Cython, don’t iterate over it in Python and invoke a Cython function at each step. Pass  to your Cython module and iterate there. This technique is used often in libraries that manage data, so it’s a good model to emulate in your own code.We use Python because it provides programmer convenience and enables fast development. Sometimes that programmer productivity comes at the cost of performance. With Cython, just a little extra effort can give you the best of both worlds.This story, \"What is Cython?

  "title": "How developer teams went remote overnight",
  "image": null,
  "content": "As the coronavirus pandemic continues to shut down cities and offices around the globe, developers and software engineers are .The good news is programmers can quite easily work wherever they have a laptop and a secure internet connection — but the cultural impacts on teams can be significant. Of course tools help, and there are more and more live collaboration features in the leading coding software (check out  for a roundup of the best ones). But other issues around remote work can’t be solved with tooling.Finding flow when operating from your home office or living room, with all of the attendant distractions, can be challenging. Distributed work can also be a source of anxiety for managers who no longer get full visibility into their team’s activities and want to maintain a high level of release velocity and resiliency.Here’s how organizations of various shapes and sizes are adapting their teams and workflows to the new remote working world.Automation software specialist Zapier has , with more than 300 remote employees spread across 17 time zones and 28 countries. “When you work remotely, you have to measure contributions by output and outcomes,” explained Doug Gaff, VP of engineering, in an email exchange with .Zapier provides its employees with , from its favorite communication tools and tactics to remote management strategies. One of the more useful posts from Zapier in the current climate is  by CEO Wade Foster.Zapier organizes its developers into “EPD trios” — made up of an engineering manager, product manager, and designer — that collectively own a distinct piece of the product. EPD trios own their relative output speed, and all outcomes align with a set of shared objectives and key results (OKRs). “They collectively own customer requests, design and UX goals, and technical architecture and debt-reduction. And most importantly, they can advocate for each other’s respective positions and interests,” Gaff added.A key value at Zapier is to “default to transparency,” which means most communication occurs in public channels  such as Slack, Zoom, and the Salesforce-owned Quip, which acts as a knowledge base. This can lead to information overload, however — to the point that no one can find anything or get their work done, as the Zapier blog post  details. Being clear, specific, and targeted in your communications is a good way to reduce the cognitive load on your colleagues.Gaff admits that it can be harder to build meaningful professional relationships when working remotely. “One way we facilitate this relationship building is by recreating watercooler moments on Slack. We have hundreds of Slack channels dedicated to hobbies and interests so people can discuss topics outside of their work and get to know each other. Time spent on these channels is seen as team building, and it’s important for leaders to take part in them as well,” he explained.This has to come with boundaries though. “When you work remotely, there’s always temptation to work 24/7,” he added. “This can lead to unhealthy habits and burnout. Remote workers need the discipline to walk away from work at the end of each day. It’s a manager’s job to encourage these boundaries and power down as well.”As teams adapt to remote working, says Gaff, you need to cultivate a culture of trust. “People are experiencing a high cognitive load: managing family stresses, learning to work remotely, potentially managing illness. The best thing you can do is look for cultural anti-patterns. For example, in some office cultures, showing up at a particular time is proof that you’re working. That does not work in remote life.”Remote work isn’t new for communications API specialist Twilio, but the pandemic has caused a massive shift. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, CEO Geoff Lawson told  that around 10 percent of the company worked remotely. “For a company like us to go from partially virtual to fully virtual in a short period of time, it’s not without its hiccups, but it has worked pretty well,” he said.Some of that 10 percent of remote workers included the team of Marcos Placona, manager for developer evangelism at Twilio. “My team has always worked on a distributed basis with direct reports in the US, UK, and across Europe,” Placona told .The various time zones involved make it “tough to work this way,” he admits, “but we have regular check-ins with the team and individuals with weekly one-to-ones.”Developer evangelists at Twilio still contribute code and have to track contributions, alongside writing documentation and filtering through reams of customer feedback. During the pandemic this team has shifted to holding daily remote stand-ups. Broader team-wide meet-ups by region are held weekly, as well as a virtual happy hour on Fridays.Zoom is the go-to tool for all video conferencing, Slack is ubiquitous for text communication, and Airtable is used for task management. Then there is the private code repository GitHub, which is used to track internal projects. GitHub also offers a way to see what people are working on.“One thing that took me by surprise is, even though I work in a distributed team, especially in week one, I noticed a lot of people were struggling to concentrate,” Placona observed. “I stressed that it was the same kind of work we have done for years but the reason was there is too much going on.“One solution I find useful is written lists of what you need to do that day. I told people to just go and ship something, publish a blog post, write a piece of code, make a tick on that list and you will feel better.”Startup TravelTime offers an API that allows customers to measure distance in the time it takes to get from point A to B, used by the likes of property search platform Zoopla and the job site TotalJobs. TravelTime’s staff has always been mostly remote due to its somewhat unusual founding story.Cofounder Charlie Davies, a self-professed “terrible developer,” was looking for some help with a KRuby library he was trying to work with. This is how he met his first employee, who was helping him from his living room in Lithuania. Davies told  via video call that his current team of 30 remains distributed across the UK, Netherlands, and Lithuania, though he does want to limit the organization’s exposure to working across too many time zones.“Autonomy, trust, and inclusion are how we run the team,” he added, saying he has been horrified by  of employers remotely monitoring their employees’ productivity levels. “Working in a remote team requires trust,” he said, “to me you have to trust the people working for you and that is a two-way thing. Every one of our developers have a stake in the company and we have a share option scheme that allows us to do that and we don’t monitor the work of our developers.”Developers fill out their own time sheets and use software like Slack for day-to-day communication, GitHub for code management, and  to manage tasks. “In a remote setting your work has to speak for itself,” he added.Davies has one final piece of advice for anyone going through this shift now: “You can’t micromanage it. That will drive you crazy and you won’t get anything done and the team will hate you for it. That trust and autonomy creates a culture of self-governance,” he said.London-based betting exchange Smarkets had a pretty strict stance against remote working before the coronavirus pandemic hit. It has shifted quickly to operating remotely, though, establishing “normal” working practices via Google Hangouts and Slack to keep everyone engaged while working from home.“We have been steadfast against [working from home] because we find that having everyone in the office and ensuring everyone sits down for lunch creates a natural flow of ideas and a level of cross-pollination across tech teams that is hard to mimic remotely,” Robin Harrison, Smarkets CTO, told .The developer teams at Smarkets work on the devops model, with all tech teams supporting everything they build 24/7, so they know how to do things remotely, just not all of the time.“In terms of what we have actually seen in terms of development on the ground, there hasn’t been too much of a change in metrics for core development,” Harrison said. “We track monthly codebase changes and commits and both of those are relatively unchanged, which shows the development process is still ticking along and releases of mobile apps haven’t changed.”One thing Harrison hasn’t been able to replicate remotely is whiteboards. “There is a reason whiteboards exist, the speed at which you can express abstract ideas is very different to the written word and the way you can collaborate with colleagues is something we are missing,” he says, adding that none of the digital alternatives have passed muster for his team.The key tools for Smarkets are Slack and G Suite, especially Hangouts, but a private instance of GitLab as a code repository, paired with Jenkins for CI/CD, is also a key part of the remote team puzzle.“It is all glued together by GitLab,” Harrison says, “so the notifications that drives are as important as any for developers to keep track of what is going on with the code base. Code reviews are formal and our development flow requires a different reviewer to approve the change, so that tool is good for that.”This means Smarkets is essentially running on a , which extends developers’ purview over the applications through production. Even when everyone is back in the office and eating lunch side by side, this new way of working is likely to prevail as developers get full visibility into their code.This story, \"How developer teams went remote overnight\" was originally published by \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n."

  "title": "HP Envy 13 Wood Series review: Walnut enhances a slender, capable laptop",
  "image": null,
  "content": "The HP Envy 13 Wood Series is the company’s second foray into natural design flourishes—remember the leather-bound ? Now the company’s thin-and-light Envy 13 laptop has a Wood Series variant, featuring a walnut wood palm rest and touchpad.While these details might seem frivolous to some, the finely textured wood panel makes for a surprisingly warm, yet practical touch in a laptop that (for the most part) nails the fundamentals. That said, the 4K display on this reasonably priced Envy model skimps on a key feature, and we also had some (non wood-related) touchpad issues.HP is offering three pre-configured SKUs for its latest quad-core Envy 13 models. We’ve already  in its “regular” form. The good news is, the special Wood Series is available in the least-expensive SKU, which offers a 10th-gen Core i7-10510U Comet Lake CPU, a Full HD (1920x1080) IPS multi-touch display, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB solid-state drive, 16GB of  (good stuff!), and an  (after a $200 discount). A step-up non-Wood model () boasts the same internals save for a larger 512GB SSD and 32GB of Optane memory. The Wood Series model we’re reviewing ups the ante with a 10th-gen Core i7-1065G7 Ice Lake processor and a 4K display that (unfortunately) lacks multi-touch, for .Let’s take a closer look at the specifications of our review model:On paper, we’re looking at a thin, light, and reasonably powerful productivity workhorse, although a few corners have been cut to achieve that discounted $1,050 price tag.On the plus side is the Envy 13’s U-series Core i7-1065G7 processor, which is Intel’s second-fastest Ice Lake CPU for laptops, plus a roomy 512GB SSD that gets a nice 32GB Optane Memory speed boost. The integrated Iris Plus graphics should rival the visuals of entry-level discrete graphics cards, while the bright (if power-hungry) 4K IPS display is always a welcome sight.So far, so good, but this particular model of the Envy is saddled with a few compromises. For starters, while the 8GB of RAM is adequate when it comes to smoothing out multitasking, 16GB would give busy people more room to queue up multiple applications and browser tabs. And while the 4K display is (as we’ll see) crisp and bright, it isn’t touch-enabled. (The HP Envy 13 models with full-HD displays  have touchscreens, and the configurable Envy has a 4K touchscreen option.) We’re also a tad disappointed by the Wi-Fi 5 networking, which means the Envy won’t be able to take full advantage of newer, faster, and more efficient .Still, if you can live without a touch-enabled display, there’s a lot to like about this Envy 13 Wood Series configuration, which also happens to be among the least expensive Core i7-1065G7-powered laptops we’ve tested (assuming you can snag the discounted price).Our HP Envy 13 Wood Series review unit boasts the same anodized-aluminum exterior that we’ve seen on other Envy models, complete with a pleasingly slim (0.57-inch) design and a “lift” hinge that props up the laptop when the lid is open, ideal both for boosting the angle of the keyboard and allowing extra airflow beneath the chassis.Opening the Envy 13’s lid reveals the signature design element of this particular SKU (and the less expensive Comet Lake version): a walnut wood palm rest and touchpad. The finely textured wood grain feels smooth yet pleasingly tactile, particularly when you’re swiping the touchpad, and I enjoyed resting my palms against the firm, yet comfortable surface. Besides its wooden palm rest, the HP Envy 13 boasts a few other nice design flairs, including the diamond-patterned speaker grille that sits above the keyboard, the flat rear spine with the sleek “Envy” logo, and a hourglass-shaped profile where the lip of the Envy 13’s lid meets the bottom edge of the laptop chassis.The 4K display on our HP Envy 13 Wood Series review unit looked predictably sharp and vivid, and it’s also impressively bright. HP’s specs promise 400 nits (or candelas) of brightness for the screen, but our own measurements gave us a 495-nit reading—so yes, we’re talking a bright display here, although it should be noted that the brightness drops precipitously after just a couple of taps on the brightness-down button. It’s also worth remembering that a bright 4K display like the Envy 13’s will take a heavy toll on battery life.The Envy 13’s display boasts wide viewing angles thanks to its IPS (in-plane switching) design. The screen dims only slightly when viewed from an angle, and I was able to read text on the display even when looking way over from one side or the other. For its part, HP promises a 178-degree viewing angle, and that sounds about right based on my experience.A missing feature on the display of this particular Envy 13 model, however, is touch sensitivity. You won’t be able to swipe or tap the screen to interact with it, nor will you be able to write or draw on it with a stylus. The lack of touch support is surprising given how common it’s become on laptop displays, particularly on mid-tier and premium models. There are other Envy models that do boast full-HD and 4K touchscreens, although a custom-configured 4K touchscreen model with equivalent specifications (save for a downgraded Core i7 Comet Lake processor) costs about $240 more than the discounted price of our review unit.The HP Envy 13’s keyboard feels solid and comfy, with snappy yet quiet keystrokes, decent travel, and easy discoverability. You also get hotkeys for media playback, airplane mode, and mute, but none for laptop settings or disabling the built-in camera (although, as we’ll soon see, there’s another way to quickly shut off the Envy 13’s webcam).While the Envy 13’s wood-crafted touchpad looks and feels great, we experienced the same occasionally jittery behavior from the touchpad on the Envy 13 Wood as we recently did with its aluminum sibling, the , and a little further into the past with units such as the . Not all typists who tried it had the same experience, so you might check your typing style for excessive palm-grazing, and try adjusting your touchpad drivers' sensitivity as well.Sitting just below the bottom-right corner of the Envy 13’s keyboard is a Windows Hello-enabled fingerprint reader, which lets you swipe a fingerprint to unlock Windows or log into Windows Hello-enabled apps. I enrolled my fingerprint shortly after I began testing my Envy 13 review unit and (aside from a very occasional hiccup) didn’t encounter any problems.I was also pleasantly surprised by the Envy 13’s top-firing Bang & Olufsen speakers, which sounded impressively robust for laptop audio components. Just to be clear, the Envy 13’s speakers can’t rival the audio of external speakers or a good set of cans, but they sounded well above average, with a rich mid-range, plenty of high-end detail and even a sprinkling of bass.While the HP Envy 13 might not give you all the ports you want, you get what you need. Starting on the left side, there’s a drop-jaw USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A port (the first of two), a Thunderbolt 3 port (which supports data transfer rates up to 40GBps), and a combo audio jack.On the right side sits a second drop-jaw USB 3.0 port, along with a microSD card slot and a barrel-shaped charging port. Also on the right side is a switch that electronically disables the Envy’s webcam (there’s no physical lens shutter, however).Missing in action is an ethernet port, which isn’t a huge surprise given the Envy’s slim-and-light design, and HDMI, which you can do without, as the Thunderbolt 3 port can power a pair of 4K displays or a single 5K display."

  "title": "Cord-cutting myths busted: Why you should stop worrying and dump cable",
  "image": null,
  "content": "While your gas, car insurance, and credit card bills have all shrunk due to the coronavirus quarantine, there’s one monthly payment that’s as big as it ever was: your cable bill. And it’s not about to go down anytime soon, even with reruns likely to stretch into the winter. So if you’re starting to explore your options for cutting cable once and for all, we’re here to dispel a few myths that might be giving you pause.Everything you’ve heard about streaming services is true: generous trial periods turn into recurring monthly bills and prices increase on a regular basis. And with more services popping up every month, it might seem like your cord-cutting bill won’t actually be cheaper than your cable one.While that may be true for people who want absolutely everything, it doesn’t take much to keep your bill low. Take Netflix, for example, , the price of the standard service has gone from $8 to $13—a $5-per-month increase—while the cost of premium service (which you’ll need for 4K resolution) has jumped from $12 to $16. Over the course of a year, that amounts to an extra $54 on average, no small number, but far less than  (set-top box rental, whole-home DVR fee, fees for additional TV connections, etc.) that get tacked onto your cable bill every month.And besides, if you cut off your Netflix subscription for a few months, you can recoup most of that cost. That’s the beauty of cord-cutting as compared to cable: there are no penalties for stopping and restarting service. The thought of dropping Netflix for a month might sound like heresy, but speaking from experience, you’ll have plenty of options to fill the gap. And when you rejoin in a month or two, just think of all the things you’ll have to watch.Since you’ll be wholly dependent on the speed of your internet connection when you cut the cord, it’s understandable to be concerned about quality. Cable is delivered via a coaxial cable that delivers optimal picture with zero lag, while streaming video depends on the quality of your network connection. That’s true, and there will be times when streams pause, buffer, quit, and glitch for no apparent reason.But for the  part, picture quality will be superb. Mind you, you’ll need either a smart TV or a streaming box or stick (an Apple TV, a Roku, or an Amazon Fire TV device, for instance), but most services offer at least some selections in 4K UHD, and even if you choose a live TV service like YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, or , you’ll get HD streams that rival what you get with Cox or Comcast.Even with hundreds of channels at your fingertips, most cable subscribers stick to a core five or 10 go-to channels when they sit down to watch something. And whether that’s HBO, Showtime, Fox, CNN, Food Network, AMC, or Nickelodeon, you’ll be able to find the shows you love.If you’re looking for live TV, a few channels will be tricky to get. For example, if you want the full slate of Nickelodeon shows, you’re basically limited to  for $20 per month or  for $60 per month. The same goes for AMC, which you can find on a few other services, including  (starting at $30 per month). But if you can wait to watch the newest episodes, you’ll find a nice library of on-demand content on Hulu and Netflix. Also, the AMC app offers sporadic free episodes of premieres and popular shows. And if you’re wondering where The CW is in your live TV lineup, you can watch whatever you want in the company’s excellent free app.Bottom line: Whatever your favorite shows may be, you’ll still be able to watch them once you dump cable. And you’ll have a vastly superior library of on-demand shows to choose from as well.With all your TV watching being funneled through your router, super-slow internet speeds won’t cut it. But that doesn’t mean you need over-the-top speeds, either. Even if you want to stream as much 4K content as possible, you can probably get away with what you already have. For a single device, 5Mbps is sufficient for up to HD resolution, and you’ll need at least 25Mbps to stream 4K UHD. That will multiply quickly if you anticipate multiple streams at once—figure 50- to 100Mbps—but you don’t need to spend top dollar to get gigabit service or anything near it unless you need to support dozens of simultaneous streams.If you find your streaming speeds are slow even after upgrading to 100Mbps service, you should consider the usual tips: move your router to a central location, update your firmware, switch to a mesh router, etc.. If your streaming device supports it, consider making a hardwired connection to your router to get the maximum speed you’re paying your ISP for (your Wi-Fi network will be slower, even with a high-end wireless router).Remember when you wanted to get cable without paying for it? You had to find a less-than-reputable cable installer, slip them a few bucks under the table, and splice into your neighbor’s line. Good news: sharing streaming services isn’t nearly as frowned upon as stealing cable.While most services limit concurrent streams, the people in charge are well aware that close friends and family members share logins and passwords. And they’re totally cool with it. So you can swap your Netflix subscription for your buddy’s Disney+ sub without running afoul of any official policy. It’s not so easy with live streaming TV services, as most enforce strict location requirements, but you can barter  for  without a problem.Just like cable TV, there are lots of ads on live streaming TV, especially on the cheaper services. They’re annoying and repetitive and often poorly timed. But it’s not like you don’t have ads on cable. And there’s a silver lining with commercials on the streaming services: Most of them have a countdown tracker, so you know exactly how much you have to grab a snack or hit the bathroom. That’s something, right?Looking for more cord-cutting tips and tricks?

  "title": "NetNewsWire 5 for iOS review: Venerable RSS reader app even better on mobile",
  "image": null,
  "content": "RSS reader apps have come and gone, but few have experienced such a bumpy rollercoaster ride as NetNewsWire. Making a splash in 2002 from developer Brent Simmons, the popular Mac version was ultimately acquired by not one but  different companies before finally finding its way back home in 2019.Along the way, NetNewsWire found its way onto iOS—and even Apple TV for a brief time—but the marriage never quite flourished. Thankfully, Simmons has rectified this situation with an all-new universal iOS version that faithfully mirrors the desktop experience I  last year, and even bests it in some ways.Those who use NetNewsWire 5 for Mac to stay current with the news already know what to expect from the new iOS and iPadOS version. The words “stable” and “fast” are frequently used to describe this free app, and the same applies here.Rather than reinvent the wheel, Simmons and his small team did a remarkable job porting the macOS edition to iPhone and iPad. On the tablet, for example, there’s a familiar three-panel layout, with sources on left, list of articles from a selected feed at center, with the remaining space reserved for reading the chosen article. Nothing remarkable on the surface, especially when other RSS reader apps like Reeder and ReadKit do pretty much the same.Where competing apps frequently get bogged down with complexity and feature bloat, NetNewsWire 5 for iOS remains lean and most importantly, free of the pesky bugs which increasingly seem to infect modern apps. (It’s a testament to Simmons’ coding prowess that not a single “hot fix” update has been necessary during the first month of availability.) One downside to being so nimble is there’s not much in the way of custom display options. If you like to tweak text size or font style, for example, this is not the news reader for you.Despite remaining faithful to the macOS aesthetic, NNW 5 takes full advantage of iOS, with excellent support for Siri Shortcuts and system-wide Dark Mode (a manual toggle switch for the latter would be welcome, however). On iPad, there’s additional support for multiple windows and—with the right accessory attached—nearly 30 keyboard shortcuts, which make the app feel more like the desktop version.Although there was little reason to sync RSS feeds with other devices prior to smartphones and tablets, it would be inconceivable to release an app without it today. Although NetNewsWire 5 for Mac remains stubbornly limited to Feedbin and locally imported feeds, the mobile edition adds sync with my preferred service Feedly to the mix. Like macOS, NNW 5 for iOS comes with 16 popular local sources ready to read.Also in the source list are a trio of “smart feeds,” essentially automatic filters for reading feeds published on the current day, all unread, or articles marked as favorites. Such options definitely help cut down on the noise factor with a volume of busy feeds, but they don’t go quite far enough. I’d love to be able to create our own custom smart feeds, for example.Navigation is fluid and intuitive. With an article open, it’s easy to jump to the next by swiping left. There’s even a shortcut for jumping to the next unread article by tapping the downward triangle on the bottom toolbar. NNW 5 features a button at the top of the article list to filter out already read feeds, as well as a “mark all as read” option along the bottom, with a preference to confirm this action first should you want it.Many options are available from the article list by holding your finger down until a contextual menu pops up, including handy shortcuts for copying feed or homepage URLs. While reading articles, options are conveniently placed in a toolbar across the bottom to leave an article unread, mark favorites with a star, switch to an uncluttered “reader” view, or share using any service installed on your iOS device including Instapaper, a feature still missing on the Mac version.Venerable RSS reader NetNewsWire makes a triumphant return to iOS with a slick universal app that’s even better than it currently is on macOS.This story, \"NetNewsWire 5 for iOS review: Venerable RSS reader app even better on mobile\" was originally published by \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n."

{"title": "Intel's 'Comet Lake-S' 10th-gen Core CPUs hit 10 cores and 5.3GHz speeds", "image": null, "content": "Intel’s latest 10th-gen “Comet Lake S” desktop processors solve the hyperthreading issues that plagued Intel’s 9th-gen chips, with a unique wrinkle: the ability to dial hyperthreading on and off on a per-core basis. The fastest of the thirty-two new chips pushes clock speeds up to 5.3GHz, though that’s specific to a single core. Intel boasts the 10-core/20-thread Core i9-10900K will be the world’s fastest gaming processor, a claim that we’re eager to test. Also in the mix are two derivatives Intel’s offered previously: specific F-series parts that lack integrated GPU cores, as well as ten T-series 35W chips optimized for small-form-factor designs.Though overall base clock speeds appear to be higher than those offered in the , however, don’t be fooled by the 10th-gen nomenclature. These are still 14nm parts, with the same UHD 630 integrated GPU as the prior generation. Comet Lake S will also require new LGA 1200 socket motherboards to accommodate TDP power that has climbed to 125W in places.Intel’s promising double-digit performance increases when Comet Lake is compared to the 9th-gen Coffee Lake, and substantially more versus an older PC.  The real question, of course, is whether Intel’s new Comet Lake chips will be able to up-end AMD’s  desktop chip and its Threadripper counterparts, the  and . Not surprisingly, Intel’s emphasis is on the need for single-core performance, its traditional area of strength. Brandt Guttridge, Intel’s senior director for desktop and workstation product marketing, explained that Intel is seeking to improve clock speed, tunability, and real-world performance. Intel didn’t say as much, but some of what Intel is offering appears to try and minimize its power disadvantage relative to Ryzen, while maximizing Comet Lake’s time in turbo mode to push performance higher.The Core i9-10900K lists for the same price as the Core i9-9900K did, initially: $488, though the $262 Intel is charging for the Core i5-10600K 6-core/12-thread part may attract more buyers. You’ll notice, though, that the power consumption of many of these new chips now touch 125W, versus the 95W consumed by many 9th-gen chips. (AMD’s Ryzen 9 3950X consumes 105W, though it’s priced at over ; the 105W  costs $409.)Intel will also continue to sell F-series versions of the Comet Lake processors. The F-series chips ship with the integrated graphics disabled, requiring customers to use a discrete GPU instead. They’re cheaper, but they also allow Intel to sell a CPU whose integrated graphics fails testing, producing more revenue for the company.The screen below lists Intel’s 17 new Core i9, Core i7, Core i5, and Core i3 Comet Lake parts. Several come unlocked (with K suffixes), allowing overclockers to push clock speeds even higher. Guttridge said that Intel sells from four million to five million unlocked processors per year, “a fairly significant chunk of our overall market.”Intel now provides much more information regarding the turbo-boost capabilities of the new chips. In this generation, Intel has migrated to Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0, which  inside a $1,700 Broadwell-E gaming CPU and then with the . In those two chip families, Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 selected a single “favored” core that it knew it could safely overclock. Within the Comet Lake chip family, the same technology selects not one, but  favored cores to be accelerated using the turbo boost capability, with no increase in applied voltage, Guttridge explained.Likewise, the highest-end chips support Thermal Velocity Boost, also found in the recent . In each, TVB works with thermal sensors elsewhere in the system to tack on 200MHz of additional speed if the system can accommodate it, up to 70 degrees Centigrade. If you’re interested in a Core i5 or below, however, all those turbo capabilities go away.An Intel representative said that the UHD630 graphics core runs at 350MHz, boosting to 1.2GHz if needed. The exceptions lie in some Core i5 processors, where the dynamic boost speed falls slightly to 1.15GHz or 1.10GHz speeds. (Intel's 9th-gen cores used the UHD630, too.)Intel also has a series of cheaper 58W parts for lower-cost systems, consisting of the Pentium Gold family. Only the lowest of the low-end Celeron chips lack hyperthreading.Finally, Intel also will offer a number of T-series Comet Lake desktop chips, presumably for NUCs and other small-form-factor devices. These 35W chips do include a Core i7 model and even a Core i9, together with some of the turbo advantages that the other chips offer. They’re not all that cheap, either.In terms of performance, Intel isn’t shying away from AMD’s recent announcements. Intel’s claim that the Core i9-10900K is the “world’s fastest gaming processor” includes the Ryzen 3950X. In a footnote attached to Intel’s presentation, Intel indicates that all of the systems were configured identically, though the configurations don’t list the chipset Intel used. “[The] 10th Gen Intel Core i9-10900K scored better on the majority of the 25+ game titles tested,” Intel claims, which include , , ,, ,, and more.For about a year,  rather than artificial benchmarks. That’s held true here as well: Intel selected a number of different games and compared its new Comet Lake chips against the previous generation Core i9-9900K as well as the Core i7-7700K, with all three systems powered by an Nvidia RTX 2080Ti. Generation-over-generation gameplay improvements range from 10 to 33 percent, with 18 percent faster 4K video editing. Compared to the Core i7-7700K, performance improved from 37 percent to 81 percent, with a 35-percent boost in video editing.Intel’s decision to push frequencies across a limited number of cores, Guttridge said, is based on its own research. “Ninety-five percent of systems that are connecting to Steam, based on our internal research, are using six cores or below,” he said. “So it’s a relatively large base of a relatively small to medium core count, however you want to define that. So the frequency on those critical six cores is a huge factor in delivering performance.”One of the most interesting features within the new desktop Comet Lake chips is the ability to turn  hyperthreading on a per-core basis, something Intel or AMD hasn’t provided anywhere else. Why do this, especially when Intel’s 9th-gen desktop chips lacked such features? According to Guttridge, Intel did so for reasons of control: allowing you to disable hyperthreading on cores that aren’t being used allows more fine-grained control. More important, however, is power: By disabling hyperthreading on cores that aren’t being used, the processor generates less heat. Less heat means that the cores that  being used can remain in turbo mode for longer periods, generating more performance overall.“Heat, as most of you know, is our enemy in terms of performance,” Guttridge said. “We don’t want to generate heat, or if we do, we want to get it out of the processor as fast as possible.”Secondly, Intel will allow users to overclock the PCIe lanes out of the CPU (the PEG interface) as well as the DMI 3.0 interface between the CPU and the chipset. Overclocking the PEG bus will allow for better throughput to and from system-level devices like graphics cards, Guttridge said. Overclocking DMI can result in some performance improvements with heavy DMI loading, an Intel spokesman added. However, PEG and DMI overclocking is considered an optional feature, and will vary by board, he said. Intel will provide what it’s calling enhanced voltage and frequency curve controls. The company will also refresh its Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU) to take advantage of “new features,” though not the per-core hyperthreading toggle. A spokesman said that the toggle will be exposed in the BIOS if overclocking is enabled. Features like per-core hyperthreading will be provided to system-level tools provided by board and system makers, Intel executives said, and will apparently vary.“Per-core hyperthreading control is exposed through the BIOS, as this change is not possible on-the-fly in Windows/XTU,” according to an Intel spokesman. “PEG/DMI overclocking is exposed through BIOS because it is motherboard specific. Each motherboard partner uniquely selects their own discrete clock generator vendor and part numbers.”While the voltage controls are exposed to XTU, overclockers are advised to check with the motherboard vendor to see if they offer their own overclocking software interface for PEG/DMI control, the spokesman added.The Comet Lake design also includes a thinner die STIM, or solder thermal interface material. The Z-height of the CPU itself isn’t changing, which would affect how heat sinks and coolers would fit. What Intel is doing, however, is thinning the silicon die which acts as a thermal insulator, and thickening the integrated heat spreader (IHS) instead. (The reduction is about 300 micrometers, down to 500 micrometers.) The additional copper should help migrate heat out of the CPU, again allowing it to remain for longer periods in turbo mode, Guttridge said. Intel also still has its  in place, Intel executives added. Unfortunately, the new LGA 1200 socket will require a new motherboard for those seeking to upgrade from the older 9th-gen parts. Intel has disclosed four chipsets to support the new Comet Lake desktop hardware, including the Z490, which appears to be a Comet Lake-optimized version of the Z390, and the H470. Intel has disclosed that the B460 and the H410 will also be available, presumably for more budget-oriented systems.Here, the most significant upgrade is likely memory. Intel has moved from DDR4-2666 on the Z390 to supporting dual-channel DDR4-2933, with two DIMMs apiece available on either channel. Enthusiasts weighing a move to Ryzen will be disappointed to learn that Intel has remained on PCI Express 3.0. Thunderbolt isn’t listed as an option on any of the chipset documentation we’ve seen.The Z490 chipset appears to be the premium offering, with the most options: sixteen PCIe 3.0 lanes off the CPU (in 1x16, 2x8, or 1x8+2x4 configurations) and twenty-four more off of the chipset. The same DMI 3.0 interface is used to connect the processor to the chipset in both the Z490 and H470.Motherboard makers designing Z490 boards also have the options of six USB 3.2 Gen2x1 ports, ten USB 3.2 Gen 1x1 ports, or fourteen USB 2.0 ports. There are six 6Gbps SATA ports, too. Other optional features include Intel’s 2.5G ethernet i219-V and RapidStorage support for RAID 0, 1, and 5.Of the three chipsets, the Z490 is the only one to list CPU and memory overclocking as an option.The H470 offers just 1x16 PCIe 3.0 off the CPU, and twenty more off of the chipset. In the H470, board makers may choose among four USB 3.2 Gen 2x1 ports, four USB 3.2 Gen 1x1 ports, and fourteen USB 2.0 ports. Six 6Gbps SATA ports are also available, and Intel’s 2.5G ethernet and RapidStorage RAID are still both options.B460 specsLike the H470, the B460 chipset allows for sixteen lanes of PCI Express 3.0 off the microprocessor, in a 1x16 configuration. An additional sixteen lanes of PCIe 3.0 hang off the chipset. There are six 6Gbps SATA ports, along with the option of either eight USB 3.2 Gen 1x1 ports, or twelve USB 2.0 ports. All three chipsets, however, include Intel’s Wi-Fi 6 AX201 (CNVio) with Gig+, which debuted . Wi-Fi 6 Gig+ increases the size of the available channels to 160MHz, allowing a total bandwidth of 1.68 gigabits per second. They all support Optane Memory, too.Documentation on the H410 wasn’t available at press time.Intel’s making bold claims about how well its new Comet Lake S chips can stack up to Ryzen, especially with the impressive, recent performance of both Ryzen 9 chips. Can Intel hold on to its gaming lead, do so without breaking users' budgets?

We start by measuring the speed of our unprotected internet connection before testing the upload/download speeds of the VPN service. These tests are conducted to servers located in North America, the UK, Europe, Oceana, and Asia over an ethernet connection with a service provision of 100Mbps.To test upload and download speeds, I closed down all background internet processes on my Mac, using TripMode. The only traffic on my system able to upload or download any data was Ookla. I used this setup to ensure that the numbers that Ookla produced were not stymied by anything else that my computer may have been doing at the time. The speeds Ookla captured were then averaged, providing us with a final numeric score.I then used those scores to calculate a percentage of difference in speeds, which is what you’ll see in our reviews. Since internet speeds change constantly based on server load, how fast your connection is, and a gazillion other factors, we feel this provides a better picture of what you can expect from a service, on the whole, than merely quoting the exact upload/download speeds we encountered during testing.Speed isn’t the only quantifiable metric that we look at. The number of countries that a VPN offers servers in, total number of servers worldwide, and how much it’ll cost you to connect to those servers on a monthly or annual basis are also taken into consideration when recommending a VPN service to you.Additionally, we conduct hours of research into the VPN providers to find out who owns them, where they’re based, what they do with subscriber information, and whether the provider has a track record of questionable business practices."},
